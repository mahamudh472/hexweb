Russian strikes also pose a threat to Ukraine&#8217;s active nuclear power plants, with particular concern for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. The security situation continues to be volatile. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine.

Make contingency plans for how and when you\u2019re going to leave Ukraine. Roads may be crowded, exposed to military action or have damage. Confirm the entry requirements of the destination you\u2019re travelling to. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Make sure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication and fuel. Keep your travel documents up to date, including for your immediate family. Continue to review your personal security plans.

January is the coldest month with daytime temperatures usually around 0\u00b0C, but in some cases winter months can be quite colder with temperatures far below zero, reaching -20\u00b0C or lower, with strong, cold northeasterly winds, called Bora.<\/p><p>In summer daytime temperatures reach 25-30\u00b0C, but sometimes quite higher, 35\u00b0C or more, especially in the inland areas.

You may be able to obtain a Green Card at the insurance company offices at some border crossings, or you should contact your insurance provider.\u00a0<\/p><p>Driving in Ukraine can be dangerous.\u00a0Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, roads may be crowded, exposed to military action or have damage, including to bridges and facilities. Hazards include:<\/p><ul><li>Poorly lit and maintained roads<\/li><li>Aggressive or speeding drivers<\/li><li>Drivers who ignore road rules<\/li><li>Drunk drivers<\/li><li>Unsafe vehicles, especially on rural roads<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Take care when driving. Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are still the leading cause of injury and death in Ukraine.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>VEHICLE MAINTENANCE<\/strong><\/p><p>A vast majority of incidents involving vehicles and breakdowns can be reduced by carrying out basic vehicle checks and preventative maintenance. In Ukraine, gas stations and vehicle servicing locations are not always open, and tow trucks cannot be relied upon (especially for armoured vehicles due to the increased weight).<\/p><p>Before you drive, check the following:<\/p><ul><li>Do you have enough fuel for your journey? (Confirm if Diesel or Petrol)<\/li><li>Check oil level, and carry spare oil.<\/li><li>Check brake fluid level and power steering levels.<\/li><li>Inspect battery terminals to confirm the connections are secure.<\/li><li>Fill up the windscreen washer fluid, and carry spare.<\/li><li>Inspect all wheels and tyres (including the spare).<\/li><li>Confirm all lights are working (and regularly clean them).<\/li><\/ul><p>You are advised to always carry a vehicle breakdown kit, including a high visibility vest, warning triangle, jumper cables, tow rope, gloves, first aid kit, flashlight, spare batteries, spare fuses, spare bulbs and a screwdriver at the minimum.<\/p><p><strong>ROUTE PLANNING<\/strong><\/p><p>First and foremost, check the <strong><u>Ukraine Risk Map<\/u><\/strong> to confirm which colour <em>Risk Zone <\/em>you will be driving in. The Red Zone is under Russian control and all travel to and within the <em>Red Zone<\/em> is advised against due to the extreme risk to life.<\/p><p>You should always ensure you have a good means of communications and that you regularly check-in with trusted people who can send Assistance in the case of an Emergency. You should also always know the routes you are driving and the location of any safe facilities along those routes that could be of use to you, including police stations and hospitals.<\/p><p>If you travel regularly, try to avoid a routine. Do not leave at the same time every day, and try to alternate your routes. This will make you less of a predictable target if you are being watched.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>VEHICLE SAFETY<\/strong><\/p><p>Vehicles should be secured or manned at all times (where possible). If they are left unattended, always lock them. Upon returning to the vehicle, they, and the area around them, must be searched for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), electronic surveillance devices, and anything suspicious.<\/p><p>The area around a vehicle must be scanned as you approach it for any suspicious vehicles or people. Criminals, and\/or sympathisers with Russia may have found your vehicle(s) and could be waiting for your approach to attack, kidnap or assassinate you.<\/p><p><strong>VEHICLE CHECKPOINTS<\/strong><\/p><p>There are Vehicle Checkpoints (VCPs) in several locations around Ukraine, manned by the military and\/or police. Ad-hoc VCPs can also be set-up with very little notice.<\/p><p>First and foremost, as you approach a Vehicle Check Point (VCP) do so slowly and remain calm. When you reach the Guard(s), always be polite and courteous.<\/p><p>They will ask for your Identification and could request to search your vehicle. While it is important that you comply, always remain diligent. If you are asked to exit your vehicle, do not leave valuables (wallet, watch, phones etc.) inside the vehicle.<\/p><p>If you are operating in the Orange Zone (see Risk Map) there is a heightened risk of what is known as an Illegal VCP, where potentially criminals, insurgents, terrorists, or enemy forces (Russians) could set-up a VCP disguised as Ukrainian Forces. Remain diligent.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1666\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"6\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1666\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" class=\"elementor-toggle-title\">Crime<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1666\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"6\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1666\"><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, is common, particularly in:<\/p><ul><li>Crowded places<\/li><li>Tourist areas<\/li><li>Bars and nightclubs<\/li><li>Public transportation<\/li><\/ul><p>In central Kyiv, criminal activity, including muggings, is more prevalent at night.

One common scam involves a person dropping a wallet or a bundle of money in front of a tourist, hoping the tourist will pick it up. The scammer then accuses the tourist of stealing some of the money. These scams can involve several crooks, some posing as police officers. If this happens to you, don\u2019t pick up the dropped items. Simply walk away without engaging in conversation.<\/p><p><br \/><strong>ROMANCE SCAMS<\/strong><\/p><p>If you\u2019re travelling to Ukraine to meet someone you\u2019ve otherwise only met online, you may be the victim of a scam.
